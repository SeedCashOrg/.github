### Image Verification for SeedCash
SeedCash provides GPG-signed images to ensure the authenticity and security of each .img file. 
You can download the latest image [here](https://seedcash.cash/resources). The following commands guide you through verifying the downloaded image on Mac/Linux and Windows.


#### MAC / LINUX

- Open a terminal in the directory containing the downloaded folder.

- Import SeedCash public key
```bash
gpg --fetch-keys https://keybase.io/seedcash/pgp_keys.asc 
```

- Verify SeedCash public key fingerprint 
```bash
gpg --fingerprint
```
<img width="561" height="108" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24d84a6-6e71-4df0-8dfb-9229068d78f9" />

To verify that the public key you imported is correct, you should compare the public key fingerprint  you see locally with the public key fingerprint you find [here](https://keybase.io/seedcash) (keybase.io/seedcash).
If they match exactly, then you have the correct key from the official source. If there’s any difference — even one character — you should consider it unsafe and re‑import/verify from the official source.
